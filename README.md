# Movie-Analysis---Python

The purpose of this project was to learn python and display my skills. I'll continue to add to and expand the scope for as long as I find the dataset has more to teach. I plan to add a section on modelling and one graph made with Geopandas.

## Limitations
I want to learn to use Plotly so I can recreate some of the graphs here. Many times I saw outliers and thought it'd be intersting to see that data point but I can't easily do that with Seaborn.
